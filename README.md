SUBMISSION OF DATA SCIENCE PROJECT TO CODSOFT

I have completed the tasks assigned for my internship as a data scientist at CodSoft. I hope this will be helpful for you.

Task No. 1: TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Utilize the Titanic dataset to build a model predicting whether a passenger on the Titanic survived. This classic beginner project provides readily available data containing information about individual passengers, such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and survival status.


Task No. 2: IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION

The Iris flower dataset comprises three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on measurements. The objective is to train a machine learning model that accurately classifies Iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements, specifically the sepal and petal measurements.

Task No. 3: SALES PREDICTION USING PYTHON

Sales prediction involves forecasting the quantity of a product customers will purchase, considering factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection. Data scientists play a crucial role in businesses by utilizing machine learning techniques in Python to analyze and interpret data, enabling informed decisions regarding advertising costs to optimize strategies and maximize sales potential.

Task No. 4: CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

Develop a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. Preprocess and normalize transaction data, address class imbalance issues, and divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to differentiate between fraudulent and genuine transactions. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, considering techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.
