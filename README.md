Built a Credit Card Fraud Detection model using logistic regression to identify fraudulent transactions. Addressed class imbalance, evaluated metrics, and visualized transaction amounts. Explored fitting to detect overfitting/underfitting. Project undertaken during my CodSoft internship showcases effective fraud detection in financial data.
